# Known Problems

- Sidebar nav order persistence may still fail after refresh in some environments. We will revisit after confirming backend responses and client update flow.
## Resolved

- Gmail label colors were not applying because we used a non-Gmail palette; updated to Gmail’s allowed color set and confirmed sync works.
