# Theme Usage and Keyboard Shortcuts

Last Updated: 2025-12-11

This document outlines how to use themes and keyboard shortcuts in the TimeFlow web application.

## Themes

The TimeFlow web application supports both a light and a dark theme to suit your preferences.

### Switching Themes

The theme can be switched using your operating system's or browser's theme settings. The application will automatically adapt to your system's preferred theme (light or dark).

- **Light Theme**: The default theme, designed for well-lit environments.
- **Dark Theme**: A darker theme that is easier on the eyes in low-light conditions.

The theme is applied using a `data-theme` attribute on the `html` element.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are available to help you navigate and use the application more efficiently.

| Keys              | Description                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Ctrl` + `K`      | Quick add a task to "Unscheduled" |
| `Ctrl` + `/`      | Show this keyboard shortcuts guide   |
| `?`               | Show this keyboard shortcuts guide   |
| `Esc`             | Close modals and dialogs      |

**Note**: On macOS, use `⌘` (Command) instead of `Ctrl`.
