# Compliance Evidence (SOC 2 / ISO 27001) — Folder Guide

This folder is where we store **audit evidence artifacts** for SOC 2 Type I readiness (and later Type II).

## Structure
- `policies/` — approved policies (small, enforceable)
- `evidence/` — evidence records (access reviews, incident tabletop, vendor list, etc.)

## How to use
- Prefer short markdown docs over screenshots.
- If screenshots are necessary, store them under `evidence/screenshots/` and reference them from a markdown file.
