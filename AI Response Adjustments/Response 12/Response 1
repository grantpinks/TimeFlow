Let's take a look at your schedule for today.
Given that you're in the America/Chicago timezone and working hours are 08:00 - 23:00, I'll make sure my recommendations respect those boundaries.
First, let's focus on your unscheduled tasks. You have one medium task titled "Gym". Given its duration of 30 minutes, it should fit comfortably within your work or personal time slots.
Now, regarding your morning exercise habit, you've specified that you prefer doing it in the morning. Considering your work hours and today's schedule, I recommend fitting this into your morning routine. However, since you're already up at 10:40 PM, I'll suggest rescheduling it for an earlier time tomorrow to ensure a good starting point for the day.
Here are my personalized schedule recommendations:
Gym (30 minutes): Schedule this task in a block between 06:00 - 06:30 AM or just after your morning exercise routine. This allows you to get some physical activity and refresh yourself before starting your workday.
Morning Exercise (30 minutes, Weekly): Consider waking up at least an hour earlier than usual tomorrow to fit this into your morning schedule.
Now, let's take a look at your Google Calendar events for the next few days:
I notice that you have several study sessions scheduled in your calendar. While I won't directly interfere with those, I want to remind you that these are already set up, and we should prioritize fitting in any new tasks or habits within their existing slots.
Here's what I propose:
Adjust "Gym" task: Since you don't have a specific time slot available today, let's delay it until tomorrow when we can better plan around your schedule.
Morning Exercise (30 minutes): As mentioned earlier, consider waking up at least an hour earlier to fit this into your morning routine.
Here is your updated schedule for the next 7 days with my suggested adjustments:
